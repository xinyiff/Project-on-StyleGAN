# Generating Images with StyleGAN

In this project, we are going to introduce the basic idea of StyleGAN. Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, have appeared frequently in the media, which showcasing their ability to generate large high-quality images. In 2018, NVDIA introduce a Style Generative Adersarial Network, or StyleGAN for short, which was one significant step forward for realistic face generation. Next further, StyleGAN was followed by StyleGAN2 in 2019, which improved the quality of StyleGAN by removing certain srtifacts. For the experiment, we will see both how to train StyleGAN2 on any arbitrary set of images; as well as use different pretained weights on Google Colab and local enviroment.
